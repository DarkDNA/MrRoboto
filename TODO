=== BUGS and other nasty stuff ===


==== FEATURES TO ADD

*** IMPORTANT ****

- Add security feature so if you can't connect to a server it dies and gives user a nice message (exceptions)

- need to handle if nick is already taken message/numeric (sent by ircd)

- Fix a main.rb file so that when you run it with params, it creates / runs the bot

- Add section if a command entered is not found, then display message to user saying so


---- less important ----

- Fix things to maybe use an array or return an array of parsed messages instead of having a that many instance variables.


- expand !time command to take timezones

- add weather feature and allow it to take a zip code arg
	
- filter/parse raw messages to come across like a real irc client.. 
    - once done, implement this as the user control/interface

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified

- Figugre out why it doesn't always respond to commands (ruby sockets slow?)

- Fix the command parsing / clean up

- clean up event handler 

- implment solution to PING/PONG

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly

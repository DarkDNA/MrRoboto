=== BUGS and other nasty stuff ===


==== FEATURES TO ADD

- Fix things to maybe use an array or return an array of parsed messages instead of having a that many instance variables.

- Fix a main.rb file so that when you run it with params, it creates / runs the bot

- need to handle if nick is already taken message/numeric (sent by ircd)

- Allow users to directly PRIVMSG bot and have same functionality and have bot talk in PRIVMSG
    - as it stands this does not work because it sets @nickOrChan to the channel or nick, so when the new botCommands object is created AND when you privmsg the bot, it sets @nickOrChan to the bots nick

    - solution is to put some logic in to determine if @nickOrChan is a channel or the bots' nick

        - if it's a channel, then it will send to channel
        - if it's the bot's nick, then it will have to parse the incoming message an send it to the nick

- expand !time command to take timezones

- add weather feature and allow it to take a zip code arg
	
- filter/parse raw messages to come across like a real irc client.. 
    - once done, implement this as the user control/interface


- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified

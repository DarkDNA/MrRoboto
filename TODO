=== BUGS and other nasty stuff ===


==== FEATURES TO ADD

- Fix things to maybe use an array or return an array of parsed messages instead of having a that many instance variables.

- expand !time command to take timezones

- add weather feature and allow it to take a zip code arg
	
- filter/parse raw messages to come across like a real irc client.. 
    - once done, implement this as the user control/interface

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified

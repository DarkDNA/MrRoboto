- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified


- Seems to parse incorrectly and if i were to have "do not give me a !beer" it runs the command
	

- ruby's send method with args works really easily
	- example: class.send method arg1 arg2

- Figugre out why it doesn't always respond to commands (ruby sockets slow?)
	- Turns out i need to split on the input stream before i split due to \r\n's this could cause a lot of issues/headaches

- Allow commands to take arguments such as !beer <NICK>

*** - Fix the command parsing / clean up
	- can do this with a logical conition (if command HAS ! , then parse it out and send to bot class

- clean up event handler 

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly

=== BUGS and other nasty stuff ===


==== FEATURES TO ADD

*** IMPORTANT ****

- need to handle if nick is already taken message/numeric (sent by ircd)

- Need to do a port # check to see if it's valid.. input from ARGV is always a String 

- Add protected methods join and part with the same ACL as quit.. they simply join or part channels

- Fix formatting of console output to be more like an irc client (only output timestamp, nick, message


---- less important ----

- Add tell command similar to say, but takes 2 args (required) -- nick and message
	- error/tell user if args aren't right
	- will send PRIVMSG to nick

- Fix things to maybe use an array or return an array of parsed messages instead of having a that many instance variables.

- expand !time command to take timezones

- add weather feature and allow it to take a zip code arg
	
- filter/parse raw messages to come across like a real irc client.. 
    - once done, implement this as the user control/interface

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified

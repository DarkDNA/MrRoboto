- ruby's send method with args works really easily
	- example: class.send method arg1 arg2

- Figugre out why it doesn't always respond to commands (ruby sockets slow?)

- Allow commands to take arguments such as !beer <NICK>

- Fix the command parsing / clean up

- clean up event handler 

- implment solution to PING/PONG

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly

=== BUGS and other nasty stuff ===

- Bug when QUIT (though command works)

- caius says to do instance variables and print htem to see what data is acutally being sent, also look into the inspect command as well as the .class

/home/plazma/code/MrRoboto/MrRoboto-WIP.rb:46:in `parseStream': undefined method `split' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
        from /home/plazma/code/MrRoboto/MrRoboto-WIP.rb:108:in `eventHandler'
        from /home/plazma/code/MrRoboto/MrRoboto-WIP.rb:148:in `run'
        from main.rb:9:in `<main>'


==== FEATURES TO ADD

- Fix things to maybe use an array or return an array of parsed messages instead of having a that many instance variables.


- add a hug command that takes 1 parameter (nick)

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified

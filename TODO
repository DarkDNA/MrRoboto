**** - planning / fixing new parsing scheme, it's getting worse and more difficult to grasp as i go on

- Allow commands to take arguments such as !beer <NICK>
	- parsing is now fixed and makes sure the command is first, so now we need to have everything after split correctly:
	- for !beer just 1 arg so it would take the next elemnt ONLY
		- if arg = nick then gives beer to nick
		- if arg = me , gives beer to self
		- if no arg , give beer to self

- Nasty bug, when entering just ! it crashes the bot, most likely due to crappy parsing
	
- add a say command that takes several arguments
	- !say args

- clean up event handler 

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified



- Following Error happens when use !quit (doesn't seem to be a big deal but would be nice to fix) :

- on freenode, to work with nickserv to see if a user is identified you need to : You would send CAP REQ IDENTIFY-MSG   .. this prepends a + to the nick if identified


- Seems to parse incorrectly and if i were to have "do not give me a !beer" it runs the command
	- This ONLY happens when command is the last word in the sentence.. need to parse it correctly to ensure that the command is the ONLY word after :

		- example: :!beer vs :!beer me
	

- Allow commands to take arguments such as !beer <NICK>

- clean up event handler 

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
	- do this on freenode with CAP identify-msg above OR you could /whois someone and parse


- Following Error happens when use !quit (doesn't seem to be a big deal but would be nice to fix) :

MrRoboto.rb:51:in `eventHandler': undefined method `split' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

- ruby's send method with args works really easily
	- example: class.send method arg1 arg2

- Figugre out why it doesn't always respond to commands (ruby sockets slow?)

- Allow commands to take arguments such as !beer <NICK>

*** - Fix the command parsing / clean up
	- can do this with a logical conition (if command HAS ! , then parse it out and send to bot class

- clean up event handler 

*** - implment solution to PING/PONG
	- PING :jettanos.darkdna.net
	- PONG :jettanos.darkdna.net 

	- split at :, put in logic above, else if message = PING , 
		- send message to PONG with server as arg

- perhaps re-write/parse message stuff.. break it down to PRIVMSG, NOTICE, etc

- figure out how to get with services and identify to nickserv and then fix auth system accordingly
